    "## Binomial Distribution Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a biased coin that lands on heads 70% of the time (\\(p = 0.7\\)) and tails 30% of the time (\\(q = 0.3\\)). You decide to flip this coin 10 times and want to determine the probability of getting exactly 7 heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "- **Number of trials (\\(n\\))**: 10\n",
    "- **Probability of success (\\(p\\))**: 0.7 (probability of getting heads)\n",
    "- **Probability of failure (\\(q\\))**: 0.3 (probability of getting tails)\n",
    "- **Number of successes (\\(k\\))**: 7\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binomial Probability Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of getting exactly \\(k\\) successes in \\(n\\) independent Bernoulli trials is given by the binomial distribution formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as \\( \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\)\n",
    "- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on an individual trial\n",
    "- \\( q \\) is the probability of failure on an individual trial (\\( q = 1 - p \\))\n",
    "- \\( n \\) is the number of trials\n",
    "- \\( k \\) is the number of successes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\)**:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\binom{10}{7} = \\frac{10!}{7!(10-7)!} = \\frac{10!}{7! \\cdot 3!}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Substitute the values into the formula**:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(X = 7) = \\binom{10}{7} \\times (0.7)^7 \\times (0.3)^{10-7}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compute this step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Binomial Coefficient\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\binom{10}{7} = \\frac{10!}{7! \\cdot 3!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability Calculation\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(X = 7) = 120 \\times (0.7)^7 \\times (0.3)^3\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "(0.7)^7 \\approx 0.0823543\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "(0.3)^3 = 0.027\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(X = 7) = 120 \\times 0.0823543 \\times 0.027 \\approx 0.2668\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 7 heads in 10 flips of this biased coin is approximately 0.2668, or 26.68%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The binomial distribution helps us calculate the probability of a specific number of successes in a fixed number of trials, given the probability of success on each trial. In this example, it helped us find the probability of getting exactly 7 heads out of 10 flips of a biased coin.\n",
